    <p><strong>Let’s get started Implementing our First Program!</strong></p>
    <p>
      Let’s implement the program that’ll send a hello message in response to
      any received messages.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get started, we'll create a new project using the following command:
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      This will create a directory structure for our project with the following
      files:
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      Next, we need to add the necessary dependencies to our Cargo.toml file.
      We'll use
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>gstd - a standard library for smart contracts on Gear</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>gtest - a library for testing smart contracts</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            gear-wasm-builder - a helping module that aids in building programs
            using Gear.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      Now, let's write the minimum structure of our Gear program in the lib.rs
      file. The handle function is the program's entry point. It will be called
      every time the program receives an incoming message.
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      To build our program, we’ll create <em>build.rs</em> file with the
      following code:
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>We can now run the following command to build our project:</p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      gstd::msg is the messaging module from the gstd library, allowing users to
      process incoming messages, obtain the necessary information about the
      sender or the message content, and send replies or new messages to other
      actors (link to gstd).
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll use the reply function that sends a new message as a reply to the
      message currently being processed:
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>Let's build our project:</p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      If everything goes well, your working directory should now have a target
      directory that resembles this:
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      The target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release directory should contain three
      WASM binaries:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          hello_world.wasm is the output WASM binary built from source files;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          hello_world.opt.wasm is the optimized WASM aimed to be uploaded to the
          blockchain;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          hello_world.meta.wasm is the WASM containing meta information needed
          to interact with the program.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Before we upload our program to the blockchain, we need to understand the
      metadata and *.meta.wasm file's use case. In the context of Gear programs,
      metadata facilitates the interaction between the client-side (JavaScript)
      and the program (Rust).
    </p>
    <p>
      Metadata can be used as a message payload description for external tools
      and applications that interact with Gear programs in the network. It is
      stored in a separate *.meta.wasm file.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gear `metadata!` macro exports functions from Rust with IO data
      specified by the user in the macro. In our example, we only need to
      declare a type for the handle output message:
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      We've learned how to create a simple smart contract program that responds
      with a "Hello" message to any incoming message. Let's test our program.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Testing smart contract with gtest library</strong></p>
    <p>
      Testing smart contracts is an important aspect of developing decentralized
      applications. We’ll use the Gear
      <a href="https://github.com/gear-tech/gear/tree/master/gtest"><span class="underline">gtest</span></a>
      library for our program’s logic testing.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get started, let's create a new directory called "tests" at the top
      level of our project directory, next to the "src" director. In that
      directory, we’ll create a file hello_world_test.rs where we’ll write tests
      for our contract.
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      In our test file, we’ll need to import the necessary modules from the
      gtest library, which are import <em>Log</em>, <em>Program</em> and
      <em>System</em>. We’ll also define a test function:
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      Before testing our smart contract, we need to initialize the environment
      for running programs. We can do this using the System module from gtest.
      The system emulates the node behaviour:
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      Next, we need to initialize our program. We can do this using the Program
      module from gtest. There are two ways to initialize a program: from a file
      or the current program:
    </p>
    <p>To initialize a program from a file:</p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>To initialize a program from the current program:</p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      The uploaded program has its own id. You can specify the program id
      manually using the from_file_with_id constructor. If you don't specify the
      program id, the id of the first initialized program will be 0x01000…, and
      the next program initialized without an id specification will have an id
      of 0x02000... and so on.
    </p>
    <p>In the next step, we’ll send messages to our program.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            To send a message to the program, call one of two program functions:
            send() or send_bytes(). The difference between them is similar to
            gstd functions msg::send and msg::send_bytes.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The first argument in these functions is a sender id, the second one
            is a message payload.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The sender id can be specified as hex, array ([u8, 32]), string or
            u64. However, you can’t send a message from the id already taken by
            the program!
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The first message to the initialized program structure is always the
            init message even if the program does not have the init function. In
            our case, it can be any message. But let’s add the init function to
            our program and monitor if that message reaches the program:
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      In our test function, we can send a message to the program using the
      `send()` function:
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      Note that we added sys.init_logger() to initialize printing logs into
      stdout, and we sent a message from the user with id 2 (id 2 transforms to
      0x020000.. ActorId).
    </p>
    <p>We can then run our test using the following command:</p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      If everything is working correctly, we should see the debug message in our
      console:
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      Sending functions in the gtest library will return RunResult structure. It
      contains the final result of the processing message and others, which were
      created during the execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, we can check the init message processing result. We can do
      this by ensuring that the log is empty and that the program does not reply
      or send any messages. To do this, we can use the
      assert!(res.log().is_empty()) command.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Contains empty log (the program doesn’t reply and does not send any
          messages);
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <ul>
      <li><p>Was successful:</p></li>
    </ul>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      Once we have confirmed that the initialization message was successful, the
      next messages will be processed through the handle function. We can test
      this by sending the next message using the program.send(2,
      String::from("HANDLE MESSAGE")) command.
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      Here, we should check that the program replied with the expected hello
      message. To do this, we can use the Log structure from the gtest lib and
      build the log we are expecting to receive. Specifically, we can use the
      Log::builder().dest(2).payload(String::from("Hello")) command to create
      the expected log.
    </p>
    <p>
      After creating the expected log, we can then check if the received log
      contains the expected log. We can do this by using the
      assert!(res.contains(&amp;expected_log)) command.
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      As you might guess, dest is the actor to which the program sends a message
      and payload is the content of that message.

    <p>Run the test and make sure that everything is fine.</p>

      </li>
      <li><p>It returns the message that was sent back to the sender.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Advanced Hello World Program Concepts</strong></p>
    <p>
      Let’s add more functionality to our program by introducing two new
      messages: SendHelloTo and SendHelloReply.
    </p>
    <p>Our program will receive 2 messages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          SendHelloTo: having received this message, the program will send
          “hello” to the specified address;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          SendHelloReply: the program replies with a “hello” message to the
          account that sent the current message.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As we saw from the previous lesson, we’ll have to decode the message the
      program received. We’ll define an enum InputMessages that will be used to
      decode the incoming message.
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      The SendHelloTo variant includes an ActorId field where the program will
      send the hello message.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also need to add derive macros #[derive(Encode, Decode, TypeInfo)] to
      the enum for encoding and decoding in messages, and add appropriate
      dependencies to the Cargo.toml file:
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      To initialize our program, we’ll define a static mutable variable GREETING
      as an Option&lt;String&gt;.
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      Until the program is initialized, the GREETING equals
      <strong>None</strong>. After the initialization, the GREETING will become
      <strong>Some(String)</strong>.
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      Next, we’ll decode the incoming message in the handle function and define
      the message the program received:
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      When the program receives SendHelloTo message, it sends a hello message to
      the specified account through the send function. On the other hand, when
      the contract receives a SendHelloReply message, it replies with a greeting
      message.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Testing the Updated Smart Contract</strong></p>
    <p>
      First, we’ll test the SendHelloTo message. We define the account id that
      will receive that message and check that in the result log there is a
      message assigned to that account.
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p><strong>Understanding the program metadata and state</strong></p>
    <p>
      Metadata is a kind of interface map that helps transform a set of bytes
      into an understandable structure. It determines how all incoming and
      outgoing data will be encoded/decoded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Metadata allows dApp’s parts - the smart contract and the client side
      (JavaScript), to understand each other and exchange data.
    </p>
    <p>To describe the metadata interface we use `gmeta` crate:</p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>where:</p>

      It is necessary to describe all the types. If any of the endpoints is
      missing in your program, you can use () instead.
    </p>
    <p>Let's define metadata for our example. We’ll create a crate</p>
    <p>hello-world-io in the directory of our hello-world program:</p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>The Cargo.toml of this crate:</p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      And in the lib.rs file, we’ll define an incoming message for the init
      function, and the incoming and outcoming messages for the handle function:
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      The input for init function is a <em>String</em>. The input for the handle
      function is an enum <em>InputMessage</em>, and accordingly, the output is
      <em>String</em>. The program state is also String (It is a set greeting).
    </p>
    <p>
      It is possible to read the program state using the state function. Reading
      State is a free function and does not require gas costs. Let’s define this
      function in lib.rs file of the hello-world program:
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      To make it possible to verify metadata for a program, we’ll use the
      metahash() function:
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      It’s necessary to add the hello-world-io crate to build-dependencies in
      <em>Cargo.toml</em> in the hello-world program:
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>We also need to change the build.rs file using the following code:</p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      After building the program, a meta.txt file will be generated as a result
      of the smart-contract compilation. This metadata file can be used in UI
      applications that will interact with this smart contract.

    <p><strong>Uploading the program to the blockchain</strong></p>
    <p>
      The easiest way to upload the program is to use the “Upload program”
      option in the Gear Idea portal -
      <a href="https://idea.gear-tech.io/"><span class="underline">idea.gear-tech.io</span></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, you need to create an account and connect to Gear Idea. Follow the
      instructions provided at
      <a href="https://wiki.gear-tech.io/docs/idea/account/create-account"><span class="underline">https://wiki.gear-tech.io/docs/idea/account/create-account</span></a>
      to create your account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you've logged in, you can select the network on which you want to
      upload the program by clicking on the gear icon in the lower left corner
      of the screen. For the Gear Academy workshop, select the workshop node
      (wss://node-workshop.gear.rs:443) and click the "Switch" button.
    </p>
    <p>
      Select the workshop node and click on the
      <em><strong>Switch</strong></em> button:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="image_placeholder.png" alt="Image Placeholder">
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, select "Programs" in the left column and upload the hello.opt.wasm
      file along with its metadata (meta.txt file).
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="image_placeholder.png" alt="Image Placeholder">
    </p>
    <p>
      Give your program a name, enter an incoming greeting message and click on
      the <em><strong>Upload Program</strong></em> button.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the program has successfully uploaded, you will see it in the program.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="image_placeholder.png" alt="Image Placeholder">
    </p>
    <p>You can now send messages to your program:</p>
    <p>
      <img src="image_placeholder.png" alt="Image Placeholder">
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also read the program state (It’s our greeting string that was set
      during the program initialization).

    <p><strong>Assignment:</strong></p>
    <p>Let's write a smart contract for a Tamagotchi game:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Create a smart contract Tamagotchi, that will store Tamagotchi’s name
          and date of birth. he state of your contract should be defined as
          follows:
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          During initialization, set the name and date of birth of the
          Tamagotchi and send a reply confirming successful initialization.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Your Tamagochi program should accept the following messages:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Name - the program answers the name of the Tamagochi;</p>
            </blockquote>
          </li>
          <li>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Age - the program answers about the age of the Tamagochi.</p>
            </blockquote>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Add the state function to your program.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Upload your contract to the workshop node at the
            <a href="https://idea.gear-tech.io/"><span class="underline">https://idea.gear-tech.io/</span></a>.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To connect your Tamagotchi contract to the frontend application, you need
      to ensure that the metadata is as follows:
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>}</p>
    <p>
      Clone the repository:
      <a href="https://github.com/gear-dapps/smart-contract-academy"><span class="underline">https://github.com/gear-dapps/smart-contract-academy</span></a>
    </p>
    <p>In the frontend directory, run the following commands:</p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>The .env.local file contains the following:</p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      It means that the application is running on the testnet node. You can also
      run a local node, upload a Tamagotchi contract, and work with contracts on
      a local node by indicating:
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">

    <p>
      <img src="image_placeholder.png" alt="Image Placeholder">
    </p>
    <p>
      Select <em><strong>Lesson 1</strong></em>, paste your Tamagotchi address and you’ll see your Tamagotchi!
    </p>
    <p>Please attach a link to the repo with your Tamagotchi contract.</p>
