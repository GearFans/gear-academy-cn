          <p>Incorporate an auction model to your smart contracts</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Let’s Get Started!</strong></p>
    <p>
      In this lesson, we'll create a contract where users can put their
      Tamagotchi up for auction. We'll implement the English auction model.
    </p>
    <p>
      This type of auction starts with the declaration of the minimum bid, which
      the Tamagotchi owner sets. After this, the interested bidders start
      placing their bids in ascending order, i.e., the next bid should be higher
      than the previous one. This process continues until there is a bid above
      which any other buyer is not interested in buying Tamagotchi. The highest
      bid is the selling price of Tamagotchi.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you might guess, your Tamagotchi contract should be extended with
      functionality that will make it possible to change ownership (it's exactly
      your homework from the previous lesson).
    </p>
    <p>
      During the auction, the auction contract temporarily becomes the owner of
      Tamagotchi. After the auction ends, the contract appoints the new owner of
      Tamagotchi - the winner of the auction. If no bids were made, Tamagotchi
      is returned to the previous owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Automatic program execution with smart contract automation</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we start coding the auction smart contract, we'll discuss smart
      contract automation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smart contracts cannot auto-execute. Their code will not run and make
      state changes on blockchain until triggered by an on-chain transaction.
      The external transaction serves as a “poke” to wake the smart contract up
      and initiate its logic. For example, we can start the auction by sending a
      message to the auction contract.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the auction time has passed, it's necessary to process the result of
      the auction. However, the result will not be processed until someone sends
      an appropriate message to the contract.
    </p>
    <p>In Gear, we solve that problem with delayed messages.</p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      The delayed message is executed after the indicated delay. It's quite
      convenient in our case: we can start the auction by sending a message to
      the auction contract. After completing all the necessary logic, the
      auction contract will send a delayed message to itself, which will settle
      the auction after the indicated time.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, the ability to send delayed messages allows you to automate the
      contract execution. The contract can self-execute an unlimited block
      number provided there’s enough gas for execution. But the execution can be
      interrupted if the gas runs out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gear protocol allows another powerful feature - gas reservation. A
      developer can reserve gas that can be used to send usual or delayed
      messages.
    </p>
    <p>
      To reserve the amount of gas for further usage use the following function:
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      That function takes some defined amount of gas from the amount available
      for this program and reserves it. A reservation gets a unique identifier
      used by a program to get this reserved gas and use it later.
    </p>
    <p>
      You also have to indicate the block count within which the reserve must be
      used. Gas reservation is not free: the reservation for one block costs 100
      gas. The reserve function returns <em>ReservationId</em>, used for sending
      a message with that gas. To send a message using the reserved gas:
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      If gas is not needed within the reservation period, it can be unreserved
      and the gas will be returned to the user who made the reservation.
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p><strong>Understanding contract state and logic</strong></p>
    <p>
      Let’s start coding the auction contract. First we define the structure of
      the contract state:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Tamagotchi_id - the address of the Tamagotchi contract that is
            currently on auction;
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            status - the status of auction (It can be ReadyToStart or
            InProcess);
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>current_bid - the current highest bid;</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            current_bidder - the address of the participant who made the highest
            bid at the moment;
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>ended_at -the time of the end of the auction;</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            prev_tmg_owner - the previous owner of the Tamagotchi (the auction
            contract has to store this account in case if no one is
            participating in the auction and Tamagotchi must be returned to the
            previous owner).
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>Let's define the messages that the contract will receive:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <em>StartAuction {Tamagotchi_id, minimum_bid, duration</em>} -
            message initiating the start of the auction. The Tamagotchi owner
            must indicate the address of the Tamagotchi contract, the starting
            price and the duration of the auction;
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <em>MakeBid { bid }</em> - the message from auction participants, to
            which they must indicate the price (bid) they are ready to pay for
            Tamagotchi;
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <em>SettleAuction -</em> the message that the contract receives
            after the end of the auction. If there were bids, then the auction
            contract assigns Tamagotchi to the auction winner. Otherwise, the
            auction contract assigns Tamagotchi to the previous owner.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      As you can guess, the auction contract will interact with the fungible
      token contract as well as with the Tamagotchi contract. That is, it'll
      send messages to these contracts and wait for replies. Therefore, the
      transactions will not be atomic and we’ll have to consider this to
      maintain the state of 3 contracts consistent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's look at each action of the contract in detail. The action
      <em>StartAuction</em> has to change the owner of Tamagotchi to the auction
      contract and set the auction parameters.
    </p>
    <p>
      We consider all the possible cases that can lead to state inconsistency.
      The auction contract sends a message to the Tamagotchi contract and the
      following cases are possible:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The Tamagotchi contract fails during the message execution either
            from lack of gas or from a logical error. It didn’t save the state
            and therefore auction and Tamagotchi are in a consistent state,
            however, the auction contract has no idea what happened in the
            Tamagotchi contract.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The Tamagotchi executes the messages, and saves the state but gas
            runs out during further operations. Then, the state of the
            Tamagotchi contract changed, however, this was not reflected in the
            auction contract.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <img src="image_placeholder.png" alt="Image Placeholder">
    </p>
    <p>The workflow of <em>MakeBid</em> action is as follows:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            User makes a bid, indicating the number of tokens he would like to
            pay for Tamagotchi.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The contract transfers his tokens to its balance and if that
            transfer is successful it returns the tokens to the previous bidder.
            The gas can run out during token contract execution, during a reply
            to the auction contract or during further execution.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <img src="image_placeholder.png" alt="Image Placeholder">
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Having received the <em>SettleAuction</em> message, the contract performs
      the following actions:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Change the Tamagotchi owner to the auction winner. The gas can run
            out during the Tamagotchi contract execution, during a reply or
            during further auction contract execution.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Transfer tokens to the previous owner. And again, the gas can run
            out during the fungible contract execution, during a reply or during
            further auction contract execution.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <img src="image_placeholder.png" alt="Image Placeholder">
    </p>
    <p>So, let’s create the following Enum for tracking transactions:</p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>and add the fields to the contract state:</p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      where the field transaction_id will be used for tracking the transactions
      in the fungible token contract.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Practicing Contract coding</strong></p>
    <p>
      In this tutorial, instead of using panic!, we'll return
      Result&lt;AuctionEvent, AuctionError&gt;. Panics use is convenient when
      the execution of the contract is atomic and there are no asynchronous
      calls in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our case, there will be quite a few asynchronous messages between which
      we must carefully track the state of the program. In such a case, using
      Result enum is the preferred option.
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll create enums AuctionEvent and AuctionError that we'll expand during
      the writing of the program.

    <p>Accordingly, the main function:</p>

            save it in the auction contract. Then we stop the message execution.

      <p><strong>System signals</strong></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In Gear programs, there are three common entry points:
      <strong>init</strong>, <strong>handle</strong>, and
      <strong>handle_reply</strong>. The Gear Protocol also introduces the
      <strong>handle_signa</strong>l entry point, which enables the system to
      communicate with programs and notify them (signal) of events related to
      the program's messages. Only the system (Gear node runtime) can send
      signal messages to a program.
    </p>
    <p>
      The system sends messages to a program if some errors during program
      execution occurred. For example, a program can panic or run out of gas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gstd library provides a separate function for reserving gas
      specifically for system signal messages.
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      This cannot be used for sending other regular cross-actor messages. While
      signals can be used for inter-actor communication, they are not suitable
      for sending regular cross-actor messages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Signal messages use gas that is specifically reserved for them. If no gas
      has been reserved for system messages, they will be skipped, and the
      program will not receive them.
    </p>
    <p>
      If gas has been reserved but no system messages occur during the current
      execution, then this gas returns back from where it was taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your program uses asynchronous messages and the #[gstd::async_main]
      macro is used to expand the handle_signal entrypoint, it will free up
      resources occupied by the program.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Gear, using custom async logic involves storing Futures in the
      program's memory. The execution context of these Futures can occupy a
      significant amount of memory, especially when dealing with many Futures.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's important to note that if a program sends a message and waits for a
      reply, but the reply is unable to be received, it could be due to a lack
      of gas. For example, if the initial message in the waitlist runs out of
      gas or the gas amount is insufficient, the reply cannot be received.
    </p>
    <p>
      To handle signals in your program, you can define your own
      my_handle_signal entrypoint and write custom logic for it. In the next
      section, we'll see an example of how to write this function in the auction
      contract.

      Let’s add the entrypoint my_handle_signal to our auction contract. That
      function will confirm whether there is a pending transaction. If there is,
      the function takes the gas reserved in advance and sends a message
      CompleteTx using that gas.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, we have to add an action for gas reservation by expanding the enums
      AuctionAction and AuctionEvent:
    </p>

    <p>
      We also need to add a field reservations to the Auction struct to save the
      ids of gas reservations:
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      Next, we'll define the method make_reservation for the Auction struct:
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      Here, RESERVATION_AMOUNT and RESERVATION_DURATION are constants defined as
      follows:
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>Then we have to add the action for completing the transaction.</p>
    <p>We’ll add the action to enum AuctionAction using:</p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>Where the transaction is an enum that we have defined before:</p>

    <p>We’ll also extend the entrypoint main():</p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      Let’s write the function my_handle_signal. This function is responsible
      for checking if there is a pending transaction and if there is a gas
      reservation available. If so, it sends a message CompleteTx using that
      gas.
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      It's also necessary to reserve gas for system messages before every
      transaction. Here’s how we’ll implement it:

    <p><strong>Assignment:</strong></p>
    <p>
      In this assignment, you will add a new feature to your Tamagotchi
      contract, which will allow it to send a delayed message to itself at a
      specified interval to check its state. If the Tamagotchi is tired, hungry,
      or not entertained, it should send a message to the user asking for
      feeding or playing.
    </p>
    <p>
      To implement this feature, you need to extend the Tamagotchi state with
      the <em>reservations</em> field, as shown below:
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      Next, you need to add two new incoming messages to the
      <em>TmgAction</em> enum: <em>CheckState</em> and <em>ReserveGas</em>, as
      shown below:
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      You also need to add three new outcoming messages to the
      <em>TmgEvent</em> enum: <em>FeedMe</em>, <em>PlayWithMe</em>, and
      <em>WantToSleep</em>. If the Tamagotchi runs out of gas, it should send
      the message <em>MakeReservation</em> asking the owner to reserve gas to
      continue checking the state.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should also add the outcoming message <em>GasReserved</em> to indicate
      a successful gas reservation, as shown below:
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      So, the Tamagotchi must send a message to itself once in a certain time
      interval. Define this interval and determine at what levels of
      <em>fed</em>, <em>slept</em> or <em>entertained</em> the Tamagotchi will
      start sending messages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connect your Tamagotchi to the application and see how it communicates
      with you!
