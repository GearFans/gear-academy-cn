    </ul>
    <p><strong>Let’s get started!</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Fungible token &amp; their Properties</strong></p>
    <p>
      Fungible tokens offer the same value and exchangeability as fiat currency.
      Much like exchanging one paper dollar for another, these digital smart
      contracts allow users to trade tokenized assets of equal worth between
      accounts. However, at a fundamental technological level, fungible tokens
      are simply smart contracts that store a mapping between account addresses
      and the number of tokens.
    </p>

      />
      <em>amount</em>
    </p>
    <p>The main function of such smart contracts are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <em>Transfer(from, to, amount):</em> This function allows you to
            transfer the number of tokens (amount) from one address (from) to
            another (to). It checks if the “from” account owns tokens, subtracts
            the necessary amount from its balance, and adds the specified token
            number to the “to” account<em>.</em>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <em>Approve(spender, amount)</em> is a function that allows you to
            give the specified <em>spender</em> account the right to dispose of
            the tokens of the account that called this function (in our case,
            it'll be <em>msg::source()</em>). In the other words, the
            <em>spender</em> account can call the <em>transfer()</em> function,
            so it can transfer tokens from the <em>msg::source()</em> account to
            the specified address. This functionality is useful when the
            transfer of tokens occurs in any of the contracts.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Let's take an <em>escrow</em> smart contract as an example.</p>
      <p>
        In this example, the goods are paid using tokens and not a
        <em>msg::value()</em>. The buyer sends a <em>deposit()</em> message, and
        the <em>escrow</em> smart contract accesses the token contract and sends
        a token transfer message. In this particular message, the
        <em>from</em> address is the buyer address.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the <em>escrow</em> contract does not have the right to dispose of
        the buyer's tokens, then the token contract will panic and prevent the
        token transfer.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <em>Mint(to, amount):</em> This function increases the number of
            tokens in the contract. Usually, this function can be called by
            certain accounts that are allowed to create new tokens<em>.</em>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <em>Burn(from, amount)</em> is a function that reduces the token
            number in the contract. Just like with the <em>mint()</em> function,
            not all accounts are allowed to burn tokens.
          </p>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Non-Fungible Tokens</strong></p>
      <p>
        Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, offer a unique way to prove digital asset
        ownership. While traditional fungible tokens are interchangeable and
        store a value, NFTs carry cryptographic certificates that demonstrate
        the owner's authority over an asset, like digital art or gaming assets.

        The main functions of the contract of such tokens are similar to

            <em>Transfer(to, token_id)</em> is a function that allows you to
            transfer a token with the <em>token_id</em> number to the to
            account. Unlike the fungible token contract, this contract does not
            require a <em>from</em> the account, since each token has its own
            owner.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>

            <em>Approve(approved_account, token_id)</em> is a function that
            allows you to give the right to dispose of the token to the
            specified <em>approved_account</em>. This functionality can be
            useful on marketplaces for auctions. When the owner wants to sell
            his token, they can put it on a marketplace/auction, so the contract
            sends this token to the new owner.

            <em>Mint(to, token_id, metadata)</em> is a function that creates a
            new token. <em>Metadata</em> can include any information about the
            token: it can be a link to a specific resource, a description of the
            token, etc.

    <p><strong>Asynchronous communication between programs</strong></p>
    <p>
      One of the key and distinguished features of the Gear Protocol is the
      Actor model for message-passing communications. Gear Protocol leverages
      the Actor model for message-passing communication, allowing parallel
      computation and asynchronous messaging to ensure faster processing times.
      The development structure provides developers with immense flexibility
      when building complex dApps.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a program sends an asynchronous message to another program, it needs to
      wait for the reply from that program before it can proceed to the next
      operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      To send a message to a Gear program, we use the send_for_reply(program,
      payload, value) function. In this function:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>program - the address of the program to send the message for;</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>payload - the message to the program;</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>value - the funds attached to the message.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr class="odd">
          <td>
            pub fn <strong>send_for_reply_as</strong>&lt;E: Encode, D:
            Decode&gt;(<br />
            program: ActorId,<br />
            payload: E,<br />
            value: u128<br />
            ) -&gt; Result&lt;CodecMessageFuture&lt;D&gt;&gt;
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p><strong>Distributed transactions</strong></p>
    <p>
      Interactions between programs in the Gear Protocol create distributed
      transactions that involve operations across actors with their respective
      states. In our case, operations are performed across actors with their
      states. The distributed transactions must possess the following features:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Atomicity: All data changes are treated as if they were a single
            operation. That is, either all of the modifications are made or
            none.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Consistency: This property implies that when a transaction begins
            and ends, the state of data is consistent.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For instance, in Ethereum transactions, global state changes only occur
      when all executions finish successfully. If an error occurs during
      execution, all changes to the state are "rolled back," as if the
      transaction had never been running.
    </p>
    <p>Let’s look at the following code:</p>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr class="odd">
          <td>
            static mut COUNTER: u32 = 0;<br />
            <br />
            async unsafe fn <strong>non_atomic</strong>() {<br />
            COUNTER = 10;<br />
            <br />
            send_for_reply(msg::source(), "PING", 0)<br />
            .expect("Error during sending message")<br />
            .await<br />
            .expect("Error during message execution");<br />
            <br />
            COUNTER = 20;<br />
            }
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      In the example code provided, the global variable COUNTER is set to 10
      before the <em>send_for_reply</em> function is called. If the transaction
      fails before <em>.await</em>, the state is rolled back, and COUNTER
      returns to 0. If the transaction fails after <em>.await</em>, COUNTER
      retains its value of 10.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s consider an example of a simple marketplace where tokens are
      transferred to the seller, and then transfers NFT to the buyer.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <img
          src="media/image5.png"
          style="width: 4.42811in; height: 3.21354in"
        />
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The picture shows the following situation:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The marketplace successfully transfers tokens to the seller;</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>During the NFT transfer to the buyer, the transaction fails.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The failed transaction during the transfer of NFTs from the seller to the
      buyer after the successful transfer of tokens would result in an
      inconsistent state, with the seller receiving payment but the buyer not
      receiving the NFT. Thus, we must consider potential failures leading to
      state inconsistency when developing applications and different standards.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Implementation of Fungible Tokens on Gear</strong></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>We propose to split the fungible token into three contracts:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The <strong>master</strong> fungible token that serves as a proxy
            program that redirects the message to the logic contract.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The <strong>Token Logic Contract</strong> - responsible for
            realizing the main standard token functions. We place the logic in a
            separate contract to add more functions without losing the address
            of the fungible token and the contract state.;
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <strong>Storage Contracts</strong>: These contracts store the
            balances of the users.

    </p>
    <p>
      The token standard has a feature of Preventing Duplicate Transaction
      (Maintaining idempotency): There are two possible risks when sending a
      transaction:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Sending duplicate transactions</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Not knowing the transaction status due to a network failure.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The sender can be assured that the transaction will only be executed once
      (idempotency).
    </p>
    <p><strong>Storage contract architecture</strong></p>

            messages received only from that address;
          </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The executed transactions. In each message, the storage contract
            receives the hash of the transaction that is being executed and
            stores its execution results in the field Executed. If Executed is
            true, then the message executed successfully, otherwise Executed
            equals false.

    <p>
      When upgrading the logic contract, there may be changes to the enum
      Operation, which means the payload structure may also change. As a result,
      the master contract does not know the specific type of payload structure
      and instead sends it as a byte array (Vec&lt;u8&gt;).
    </p>
    <p>
      The logic contract sends only one message to the storage contract during
      the message Mint, Burn or Transfer between accounts in the same storage.
      Upon receiving the message, the logic contract decodes the payload from a
      byte array into the expected enum Operation. This allows the logic
      contract to process the message based on the specific operation type
      (Mint, Burn, orTransfer)

      When the transfer occurs between 2 different storages, the contract acts
      as follows:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The logic contract sends the DecreaseBalance message to the storage
            contract.

        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            If the message executes successfully, the logic contract sends the
            message IncreaseBalance to another storage contract. Otherwise, the
            logic contract saves the status failure and replies to the main
            contract.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            If the message IncreaseBalance executes successfully, the logic
            contract saves the status and replies to the main contract. If the
            gas ran out during the IncreaseBalance execution in the storage
            contract, the logic contract saves the status DecreaseSuccess. This
            status is untrackable in the handle_signal function.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        If a transaction has been executed unsuccessfully, it could be due to an
        issue with the contract memory. The logic contract must trace storage
        contracts and re-run any failed transactions to prevent failure. If the
        errors persist, then the balance should be returned.

      The contract receives a message from an account with a specific nonce,
      which is used to compute the transaction hash, along with the account
      address. It is the user's responsibility to keep track of their nonce and
      increase it with each subsequent transaction. However, it is possible to
      design the contract in a way that automatically tracks the user's nonce,
      making the nonce field optional.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main contract just redirects that message to the logic contract
      indicating the account that sends a message to it.

      In this assignment, you will add the functionality to your Tamagotchi
      smart contract to allow for changing ownership and approving other
      accounts to change ownership. This will involve implementing the following
      functions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Transfer(new_owner) - that action must change the field owner to the
            indicated account;
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Approve(allowed_account) - that action must fill the field
            approved_account the indicated account;
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
