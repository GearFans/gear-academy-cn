      <strong>Lesson 7 : The Tamagotchi Battle Logic &amp; Implementation</strong>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Lesson Summary</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            This lesson focuses on the contract that facilitates battles between
            two Tamagotchis.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The battle contract can be in one of four states: Registration,
            Moves, Waiting, and GameIsOver.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The Battle struct contains information about the players, the
            current state of the game, the current turn, the Tamagotchi store
            ID, the winner, and the number of steps taken so far.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            To participate in the game, users must allow their contracts to
            receive game-related messages like TmgAction::TmgInfo and
            StoreAction::GetAttributes.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The register function obtains information about the Tamagotchi owner
            and its attributes from the shop, generates the Tamagotchi's power
            and energy randomly, and registers the Tamagotchi.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The get_owner and get_attributes functions retrieve information
            about the Tamagotchi's owner and attributes from the store,
            respectively, while the get_turn and generate_power functions
            generate pseudo-random numbers to determine who starts the game and
            the Tamagotchi's power, respectively.
          </p>
        </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Lesson Objectives</strong></p>
    <p>By the end of the lesson, you will:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Understand the contract that facilitates battles between two
            Tamagotchi.

      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Understand the information contained in the Battle struct, such as
            player information, game state, winner, and number of steps taken so
            far.

      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Know the functions used to retrieve information from the store and

        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Let’s get started!</strong></p>
    <p>The battle contract can be in 3 states:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <em>Registration</em>: the battle contract is waiting for the
            Tamagotchi owner to register them;
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <em>Move</em>: the Tamagotchi owners are making the move in turns;
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <em>Waiting</em>: after the Tamagotchi owners made their moves, the
            battle contract gives them time to equip their Tamagotchi.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <em>GameIsOver</em>: the battle is over, it’s necessary to send a
            message <em>StartNewGame</em>.
          </p>
        </blockquote>

    <p>
      To participate, users must allow their contracts to receive game-related
      messages as below:

    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>The register function:</p>
    <p>It allows the registration of two Tamagotchi for battle.</p>
    <p><img src="image_placeholder.png" alt="Image Placeholder"></p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Before you register a Tamagotchi, the Battle contract must receive
            the Tamagotchi’s owner and its attributes from the shop;
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            After receiving the details, the Battle contract randomly generates
            the Tamagorchi’s power and energy;
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            If one Tamagotchi is registered, it remains in the Registration
            state;
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            If two Tamagotchi are registered, the battle contract randomly
            determines who starts playing first and goes to the Moves state.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      The <em>get_owner</em> function retrieves the Tamagotchi's owner from the
      Tamagotchi contract.
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      Similarly, the <em>get_attributes</em> function retrieves the Tamagotchi's
      attributes from the shop.
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      To determine which player starts the game, we use the
      <em>get_turn</em> function, which pseudorandomly selects the starting
      player :
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      The <em>genetate_power</em> function pseudorandomly generates a power
      value for the Tamagotchi:
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      There are also two constants, MAX_POWER and MIN_POWER, that define the
      upper and lower bounds of the Tamagotchi's power:
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>Next, as an example, we will define a very simple game mechanic:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The Tamagotchi owner makes a move by simply sending a message
            <em>BattleAction::Move</em> to the battle contract. During that
            move, their Tamagotchi beats the opponent’s Tamagotchi. The
            opponent’s energy decreases by the force of its strike.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Now, there is only one attribute in the Tamagotchi store that can be
            used in the game - a sword. If the attacking Tamagotchi has a sword,
            the force of its strike is multiplied by SWORD_POWER:
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <blockquote>
      <p>SWORD_POWER * power</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Otherwise Tamagochi's strike power is simply their power.</p>
    <p>
      In the future, you can expand the logic by adding fighting attributes to
      the store, as well as adding the movement of the Tamagotchi across the
      field.
    </p>
    <ol start="3" type="1">
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            If both players have made three moves, the game enters a waiting
            state, and the players can equip their Tamagotchis with items from
            the shop. After a set delay, the Tamagotchis' states are updated,
            and the next round begins.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <img src="image_placeholder.png" alt="Image Placeholder">
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      The <strong>UpdateInfo</strong> action just updates the changes in
      Tamagotchi states and starts the next round:

    <p>
      So, we have finished the simple realization of the battle between
      Tamagotchi.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can try to take part in the battle with your Tamagochi or create some
      Tamagotchi (using the previous lesson) and make them fight (Link to web
      application).

    <p>Now it’s time for your coursework.</p>
    <p><strong>Coursework:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Add more fighting attributes to the store contract;</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Determine the power of these attributes. You can also add the
            opportunity to upgrade various attributes (That will also require
            extending the logic of the store contract);
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Allow the player to choose which weapon he will fight or defend
            during the turn;

      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            It is also possible to add the ability to Tamagotchi to move left or
            right;
          </p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Be creative and think about other possible ways to make the game
            more interesting.
