      Gear Foundation is delighted to introduce its new educational initiative,
      Gear Academy. Gear's first offering - the 'Gear Smart Contract Developer'
      course â€“ will be free, providing an in-depth introduction to developing
      decentralized applications with Rust on networks like
      <a href="https://vara-network.io/"><span class="underline">Vara Network</span></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through comprehensive guidance, learners will configure a development
      environment, build DApps from scratch and delve into powerful features
      such as delayed messages, system signals or gas reservations enabled by
      the Gear Protocol.
    </p>
    <p>
      The course consists of seven engaging, easy-to-understand lessons that
      gradually reveal the features and details of program development on Gear
      Protocol.

      At the end of each lesson, learners will complete an assignment and upload
      it to the platform for review by the Gear Academy instructor. The course
      culminates in a final project that combines all the knowledge gained
      throughout the course. Upon completion, learners will receive a
      certificate and a commemorative gift NFT.
