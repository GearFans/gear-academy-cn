    </ul>
    <p><strong>Let’s get started!</strong></p>
    <p>The buying process involves three steps:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The Tamagotchi sends a message to the fungible token contract to
            approve the store contract to transfer its tokens;
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The Tamagotchi sends a message to the store contract, indicating the
            attribute it wants to buy;
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The store contract sends a message to the fungible token contract to
            transfer the tokens to itself. If the tokens are successfully
            transferred, the store adds the attribute to the the Tamagotchi
            attributes.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><img src="image_placeholder.png" alt="Image Placeholder"></p>
    <p><strong>Coding</strong></p>
    <p>
      Let's start writing the smart contract. First, we’ll define the structure
      of the store contract state:
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>We’ll use <em>type alias</em> to improve the code readability:</p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>The Metadata for the attribute contains the following fields:</p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>Let’s define the actions that the store contract must execute:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The contract must create new attributes and sell them to the
            Tamagotchi contracts;
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The contract must receive messages from the Tamagotchi contracts.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Before implementing these functions, we’ll define the
      <em>contract store's store-io crate and write the</em>
      <em>lib.rs</em> file:
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      The store contract will accept two types of messages:
      <em>CreateAttribute</em> and <em>BuyAttribute</em>. On successful message
      execution, it'll reply with <em>AttributeCreated</em> or
      <em>AttributeSold.</em>
    </p>
    <p>We’ll then write the basic structure of the program as follows:</p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      The buy_attribute function is asynchronous since the store contract must
      send a message to the token contract and wait for a reply from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, let's implement the create_attribute function. This function is
      straightforward and performs the following steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Verifies that the account that sent the message is the contract
            admin.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Ensures that an attribute with the indicated ID doesn't already
            exist.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Creates a new attribute</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Sends a reply indicating the successful creation of the attribute.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      Next, let's dive into the implementation of the
      <strong>buy_attribute</strong> function. As we discussed earlier, this
      function is responsible for initiating a token transfer from the
      Tamagotchi contract to the store contract, and it must track the
      transaction's ID in the fungible token contract. To achieve this, we will
      add a new field called <strong>transaction_id</strong> to the store
      contract's state.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, the store contract is responsible for tracking the transactions in the
      fungible token and has to consider the ID of the current transaction in
      it. Let’s add the field transaction_id to the contract state:
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      This field will store the ID of the current transaction and will allow the
      store contract to track the status of the token transfer with ease. With
      this field in place, the buy_attribute function can initiate the token
      transfer, track the transaction's ID, and wait for a reply from the
      fungible token contract to confirm the transfer's success.
    </p>
    <p>
      And we also declare the type for transaction <strong>id</strong> in the
      <strong>store-io</strong> crate:
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>Next, let’s assume the following situations:</p>
    <p>
      <img src="image_placeholder.png" alt="Image Placeholder">
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The Tamagotchi sends a message to the store contract to buy an
            attribute;
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The store contract sends a message to the fungible token contract
            and receives a reply about the successful token transfer;
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The store contract begins changing its state. It adds the indicated
            attribute to the Tamagotchi ownership but runs out of gas.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      In such a scenario, the tokens were transferred to the store contracts but
      the Tamagotchi didn’t receive its attribute. To prevent this, it's
      important for the store contract to detect when a transaction is
      incomplete and continue its execution accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>Let’s add another field to the <em>AttributeStore</em> struct:</p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      When the store contract receives a purchase message from a Tamagotchi, it
      checks if the Tamagotchi is already involved in any incomplete
      transactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Tamagotchi has an incomplete transaction, the store contract
      retrieves the transaction number and attribute ID associated with the
      transaction, and resumes the transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the previous message wasn’t completed, the Tamagotchi has to send
      another identical message to complete the transaction. However, it's
      possible that the Tamagotchi sends multiple purchase messages and fails to
      notice that some messages did not go through.
    </p>
    <p>
      To handle this, the store contract checks the attribute ID specified in
      the current message and compares it with the attribute ID stored in
      transactions. If the saved id is not equal to the indicated one, then the
      store contract asks the Tamagotchi to complete the previous transaction.
      Otherwise, it continues the pending transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Tamagotchi has no pending transactions, then the store contract
      increments the <em>transaction_id</em> and saves the transaction.
    </p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      Note that you have to add <strong>CompletePrevTx</strong> event to
      <strong>StoreEvent</strong> to ensure proper event tracking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s write the function for selling attributes. Selling attributes is
      similar to executing the NFT transfer. We’ll assign the attribute ID to
      the Tamagotchi contract.
    </p>
    <p>First, we’ll write the function for the token transfer:</p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      We’ve sent a message to the token contract and handled its reply. The
      contract considers that the message to the token contract was successfully
      processed only if it received the <em>FTokenEvent::Ok</em>.
    </p>
    <p>Now, we’re ready to write the function for selling attributes:</p>
    <img src="code_placeholder.png" alt="Code Placeholder">
    <p>
      First, the contract receives the attribute price, then it calls the
      function <em>transfer_tokens</em>. If the result of the token transfer is
      successful, it adds the attribute to the Tamagotchi contract.
    </p>
    <p>Great! We’re done writing the contract logic.</p>
    <p>Now, you should give your Tamagotchi the ability to buy attributes.</p>
